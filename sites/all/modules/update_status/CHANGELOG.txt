Update Status 5.x-2.5  (2010-01-18)
Bug fixes:
  o #687368 by dww: Fixed a call-time pass-by-reference bug that was
    introduced in version 5.x-2.4 via issue #162788.


Update Status 5.x-2.4  (2010-01-16)
Bug fixes:
  o #155450 by JoshuaRogers, dww: Moved cached data into a separate
    table in the database using a private (non-volatile) cache API.
    This prevents critical bugs where sites would repeatedly attempt
    to fetch available update data in various cache configurations.
  o #267724 by dww: Fixed bug where update_status was not checking for
    new data when the cache was cleared, until the set time was elapsed.
    Now update_status checks on cron after the cache was cleared.
  o #386636 by dww: Fixed bug where the settings to ignore certain
    projects would not take effect in some cases when modules were
    marked unsupported by the maintainer.
  o #499828 by Dave Reid: Fixed release date on multi-module projects to
    always use the most recent datestamp, not the first datestamp we find.
  o #319033 by Dave Reid, Ralf, dww: Fixed the order of the "Available
    updates" report so that it is sorted by project name, not by the
    names of modules included in each project.

Other changes:
  o #162788 by dww, Dave Reid, JohnAlbin: Added a setting to check update
    status on disabled modules.
  o #243253 by dww: Put in a check while fetching available updates to
    see if the server was reachable and to bail out before trying to
    fetch data for all projects if a server is down.
  o #431148 by pwolanin, JoshuaRogers, dww: Made it easier to visually
    distinguish between security updates and regular updates.
  o #445748 by dww: Added a hook_update_status_projects_alter() for
    modules that wish to modify data in update status module.
  o #314009 by igor.stamatovski: Added a Macedonian (mk) translation.


Update Status 5.x-2.3  (2008-08-14)
  o #217977 by dww: Fixed bug in Spanish (es) translation where the list
    of included modules was not printed due to a missing '%modules'.
  o #238564 by scor: Made the link text in a watchdog message translatable.
  o #275051 by dalin: Fixed bug where the notification threshold setting
    wasn't working due to a typo in the name of the variable. This bug
    was introduced in version 5.x-2.1 via #197186.
  o #295152 by dww: Fixed version comparison bug that resulted in '5.1'
    being confused with '5.10'.  Arguably this is a PHP bug, but we need
    to work-around it for now, anyway.
  o #232041 by dww: Increased the PHP time limit while fetching updates.


Update Status 5.x-2.2  (2008-02-04)
  o #216750 by dww: Fixed an important bug where releases from higher
    branches than the currently installed version were not ignored in
    all cases. This resulted in bogus security warnings, and faulty
    information printed about development snapshot releases (#216309).
  o #216366 by dww: Restored ability to ignore projects that are
    missing security updates or have been unpublished/revoked. This
    bug was introduced in version 5.x-2.1 via #197186.
  o #216632 by webernet, dww: Improved accessibility of the available
    updates report by adding alt tags and title attributes to the icons.
  o #216008 by Greggus: Added a Polish (po) translation.
  o #217771 by dww: Added some CSS to prevent wrapping of release dates
    when viewing the available updates report with a narrow window.


Update Status 5.x-2.1  (2008-01-30)
  o #178892 by webchick: Use an API function to get the private key.
  o #184900 by webernet: Fixed bug where email wasn't getting sent in
    some cases when it should have been.
  o #196775 by dww: Fixed a bug that caused truncated error messages to
    be displayed when the site is running an insecure version of core.
  o #197186 by dww: Backport of major update.module patch from D6 core:
    - Fixed bug where update_status would not warn sites when a
      currently installed release or an entire project being used has
      been unpublished.
    - Added support for project maintainers that want to support
      multiple major versions (branches) for one version of core.
    - Added support for flagging both individual releases and projects
      as "unsupported" or "insecure", to pave the way for new
      workflows (instead of just unpublishing things) for the Drupal
      security team and project maintainers.
    - Reorganized and simplified some code to avoid duplication and
      needless complications.
  o #208687 by dww: Fixed major bug that printed bogus results and
    recommended that users downgrade to an older version when a site
    upgraded a module or Drupal core but did not manually refresh the
    available update data. Now, before using the cached available
    update data, the code ensures that none of the .info files have
    been changed since the last time it fetched data.
  o #158526 by dww: Changed the hook_version_alter() API exposed by
    update_status to be hook_system_info_alter() so that all
    attributes in the .info files can be altered. This API change is
    required to fix some bugs in the http://drupal.org/cvs_deploy
    module, which is the only known user of this API.
  o #200028 by agentrickard, dww: Significantly enhanced performance
    of the admin/* pages by adding DB caching for the list of
    installed modules and their current status. The cache is cleared
    every time new available release data is fetched, every time the
    admin visits the modules page, status report, or available updates
    report, or every hour if nothing else clears it before that.


Update Status 5.x-2.0  (2007-08-14)
  o #165695: Added another database update to completely rebuild the menu
    since the "Check manually" path moved to "admin/logs/updates/check".
  o #165638: Improved usability for the "Check manually" link on the
    update report by wrapping it in () and adding some padding.
  o #155483: Simplified the description of the email notification setting.
  o #155878: Re-use the same t() string for both the watchdog() and
    drupal_set_message() when fetching information about available updates.
  o Added or updated translations:
    - Czech (cs)
    - German (de)
    - Greek (el)
    - Hungarian (hu)
    - Italian (it)
    - Norwegian (nb)


Update Status 5.x-2.0-rc2  (2007-08-07)
  o #155483: Backported numerous improvements from update.module in 6.x core:
  == General ==
    - The module now nags site administrators on admin/* if the site is
      missing a security update.
    - Added a drupal_set_message() when fetching data manually (success
      or failure) and cleaned up wording of watchdog().
    - Added watchdog() error message when you can't fetch any data.
    - The menu callback for manually checking is now at
      'admin/logs/updates/check'.
    - Lots of internal improvements to the code to improve clarity.
  == Available updates report ==
    - Used format_interval() for the "Last checked:" date and time.
    - Removed the "Ignored" part whenever a row on the update report is
      yellow, except for when something is ignored because of the settings.
    - Changed the wording when the "Notification threshold" is set to
      "Only security updates", and you have a non-security update
       available. Now, it just says "Update available".
    - Added support for a variable to override the default fetch URL.
  == Settings page ==
    - Moved the email notification setting to the top of the page.
    - Renamed "Error threshold" to "Notification threshold" and improved
      the description.
    - Fixed t() bug in form_set_error() during email validation.
    - Removed the setting to opt out of the usage reporting.  No one
      who's willing to run this module in the first place could
      possibly complain about the random string appended as a query arg
      on the fetch URL, and the extra setting needlessly complicates
      the settings page.
  o Fixed a notice on the status report page when the available update
    cache is empty: we were generating a 1/2 constructed line for core
    and a full line for contrib.  Now, if the cache is empty, we just
    generate the warning line for core and nothing for contrib.
  o Fixed minor bug: the status report text was missing a space.
  o Fixed bug caused by variable name typo: $base_util vs. $base_url.
  o Made the status report table all 100% wide for a more consistent UI.
  o #155281: Use flexible path for serving/fetching release history.
  o #155428: Removed the human-readable menu path from the notification
    email since it was considered a burden to translate.
  o Added an implementation of hook_uninstall() to purge variables.
    It's important that when sites running this want to upgrade to 6.x
    core that they first uninstall this module, or they'll be left with
    stale variables.
  o Updated README.txt to reflect recent changes and to mention
    uninstalling the module before upgrading to 6.x core.


Update Status 5.x-2.0-rc  (2007-06-27)
  o #124715: Added setting for email notifications when updates are available.
  o #154868: Fixed bugs and inconsistencies with security update warnings.
  o #153757: Renamed the "Warning threshold" setting to "Error threshold".
  o #149079: A few CSS tweaks and fixes for recommended version:
    - Renamed the CSS class to "version-recommended-strong" to indicate
      it's the strongly recommended version among many (the old name,
      "version-recommended-not-latest" isn't good since "Latest" isn't
      the only possible thing we're distinguishing against).
    - Fixed classes so that if we're recommending a security release,
      it gets the subtle "zebra" stripe, too.
  o #154689: Restored the CSS classes on the per-project settings table,
    (and made them consistent across all rows), but made them more
    specific to avoid name conflicts.
  o Fixed minor glitch in the logic for when to display the
    'Development version'.
  o Fixed bug in hook_version_alter() invocation for CVS deploy
    integration (http://drupal.org/project/cvs_deploy).
  o Updated screenshot to show off recent UI and functionality improvements.

Update Status 5.x-2.0-beta2  (2007-06-26)
  == Bug fixes ==
  o #153756: Fixed math bug when comparing the timestamps of dev snapshots.
  o #153798: Fixed warning logic for development snapshots and flag
    security updates.
  o #153502: Made update_status E_ALL compliant.
  o #154540: Minor wording fixes for the UI and help texts.
  o #153569: Fixed obscure CSS problem for Firefox 2.0.0.4 on Windows XP.
  o #154689: Fixed settings page bug in marvin theme due to CSS class conflict.
  o Don't clear the update_status cache when an admin saves the system
    themes page, since in 5.x, there is no information about theme updates.
  == New features and enhancements ==
  o #153741: Added support for optionally reporting anonymous usage statistics.
  o #153757: Added a setting to only warn when there are security updates.
  o #154049: Added a setting to control how frequently to check for updates.
  o #146564: Major performance gain for fetching available update data:
    directly fetch the .xml files instead of going through the Drupal menu
    callback inside project_release.module.
  o #153783: Don't hard-code dark black (#000) in update_status.css, use
    theme's default foreground color.
  o #149079: Further visual clarity about the recommended version: use a
    subtle "zebra stripe" with a slightly lighter shade of the status
    color for the entire recommended version line.
  o Completely re-wrote the README to match 5.x-2.* reality.

Update Status 5.x-2.0-beta  (2007-06-20)
  o Major re-write to use a whole new system for finding available updates.
  o Lots of improvements to the user interface and internals of the code.
  o #125742: The status report indicates updates involving security issues.
  o #149918: Add support for "Also available" entries in the status report.
  o #150316: All CVS-specific code has been moved into the CVS Deploy module:
      http://drupal.org/project/cvs_deploy
  o #144694: Available update data now stored in the {cache} table instead
      of the {variables} table for better performance and functionality.
  o #149921: Clear update_status cache when you enable/disable modules.
  o #145095: Core modules were not always considered part of Drupal core.
  o #141507: Fixed bug in the links to manually run cron to find updates.
  o #151734: Display the administrator's note when a project is
      ignored due to the settings.
  o #149079: Highlight the 'Recommended' version if there are other
      things listed ('Latest version', 'Also available', etc).

Update Status 5.x-1.2  (2007-04-13)
  Fixed broken notify on administer and status pages.

Update Status 5.x-1.1  (2007-04-13)
  o #123100: Provide a graceful error message and exit if 'gzinflate' cannot be found.
  o Attempt to guess at the project and version for projects checked out of CVS.
  o #131049: (by Senpai) Fix for CSS to ensure the font color is visible with our backgrounds.
  o #124377: Add a link to the release notes.
  o #125489: Include date with available version.
