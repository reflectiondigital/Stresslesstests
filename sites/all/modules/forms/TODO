Stuff still TODO:

* integrate a hook system for adding custom field types and custom validators
* integration with Adrian's wizard.inc
* methods for using custom field widgets
  ( just offering all form_*() doesn't work, since the paramater lists are
  often quite different (i.e. form_select vs form_textfield)
